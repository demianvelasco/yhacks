Grocery Guard
======

Grocery Guard is an Android application developed over 24 hours during YHack 2013.

The app keeps track of when your groceries will expire. You scan in receipts using your phone's camera. The image is filtered using Leptonica and OCR is performed using Tessaract. The app recognizes 4 digit PLU (Price look-up) codes which are standardized. There is a database of codes kept on Parse.com which the app queries. The app can also give you receipes based on which ingredients you have.
